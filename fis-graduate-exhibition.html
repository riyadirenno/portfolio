            <h4 class="projects-sub-titles">Project Overview</h4>
            <p>For our last submission for the Self-Directed Design module, we were tasked to develop a brief where we were given complete freedom to what we will produce by the end of the module. The project should be an experience of self-exploration and self-development. I’ve discovered that the design collaterals and assets used for our annual graduate exhibition were made by the college, not by the students. I personally felt that this was a missed opportunity by the college, hence I decided to create a brand new identity for the annual FIS graduate exhibition, complete with a style guide which will showcase the new designs and its applications in different mediums.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The FIS Graduate Exhibition is the final showcase of graduate student work from the Department of Creative Arts, Media and Music at Dundalk Institute of Technology. FIS showcases the work of students from BA (Hons) Film and Television Production, BA (Hons) Production of Music and Audio and BA in Media Arts.</p>

            <h4 class="projects-sub-titles projects-padding-content">Discussion</h4>
            <p>As the project itself states that we could do whatever we want, I spent the first few weeks researching and gathering references to what I want to produce by the end of the project. I had a very clear vision towards the style that I was looking into experimenting on, as I was very influenced by Brutalism at the time. I’ve wanted to use bold and striking typefaces, restrict the use of colours, and play around with shapes and curves.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this time, I’ve not decided on the main theme and project deliverables for the project. However, it was during the same time where most of us were spending most of our time working on our final year project for the FIS graduate exhibition. I’ve always had a strong affinity to graduate exhibitions, and it allows students to showcases the skills and the knowledge they have learned throughout their time in the institute. One thing that our college does differently compared to some of the other colleges in the country is that the design collaterals and assets that were used for the exhibition were designed and developed by the college, not by the student themselves. I personally felt that the college should’ve to delegate this task to the students as it creates another platform to showcase their skills and knowledge they’ve picked up in college and it gives us experience on working in a scaleable project.</p>

          <div class="col-xl-8 offset-xl-2">
            <p>Similar to other projects, I’ve always set a goal before I get started. I’ve had experience in designing design collaterals for different companies during my time at Studio Lengua. However, since this project gives me total freedom towards the project deliverables, I decided to push myself in this project. Final deliverables in this project include logos, name cards, posters, invitations, exhibition collaterals, social media posts and style guide.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the project itself has a lot of deliverables, it was important to properly delegate all the tasks and see which one requires more attention than the other. I quickly find out that once I have the logos and style guide done early on, I was able to work on the rest of the design collaterals using the style guide as a reference along the way.</p>

            <h4 class="projects-captions">Figure 2. Social Media Posts for FIS Graduate Exhibition</h4>
          </div>

          <div class="col-xl-8 offset-xl-2">
            <p>Another challenge that I gave myself during the project is to create a custom typeface for the logo. I used a simple square as a base and played around the shape by adding a few curves and adjusting its placement. I’ve personally felt the logo worked fine, though I have some concerns to whether it will be legible enough or not. The very monotonous colour palette I opted for this project was an interesting design decision by me, as I originally planned to use a full range of colours in the final design. I’ve decided in the end that the colours in the final iteration of the design provide enough contrast to have all the text and assets stand out in its own.</p>

            <h4 class="projects-sub-titles">Key Takeaways</h4>
            <p>In the end, I’m personally pleased with my final deliverables for this project and I would say that I’ve successfully achieved the goals I set myself early on. I do felt that I was a tad bit ambitious when I was writing the brief, though I was very proud of what I have produced by the end of the project. I've learned a lot throughout this project, such as delegating your workload and meeting a self-imposed deadline.</p>

            <p>I would like to thank my lecturer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fiachra-o-cuinneagain-aa466658/">Fiachra O’Cuinneagain</a> for the support and feedback he had provided me throughout the module, and thank you to the fine folks at <a href="http://www.devenneys.ie/main-page.html">Devenneys</a> for assisting me on printing all the design collaterals.</p>
